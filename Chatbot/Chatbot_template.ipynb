    "Most of the progress on the chatbot was made in and after labs associated with its development, where I would consistently try to implement the features discussed into my own chatbot. I would prioritize completing lab work first before any implementation to make sure I understood exactly what sort of features I could add. I would then create a separate chatbot using only what was in lab. This led to many different iterations of chatbots, mainly one with a memory system, and another with a file read system.  As the project grew it became more difficult to meet these deadlines, with lab work from sessions occasionally spilling into each other, leaving me slightly behind with the newest implementation. This however was quickly overcome by simply adjusting my schedule to leave more time for chatbot development.\n",

This made the readability and navigation of the code much better, also improving debugging thanks to being able to run separate blocks of code independent of each other. This meant that I had pretty much no issues as the project size increased, only occasionally when closely related functions were in separate blocks, which mainly involved the main chatbot loop since that’s where all the functions are being called and used in tandem with each other. I addressed this by making sure to consistently add comments during development along with clear variable names.\n",
